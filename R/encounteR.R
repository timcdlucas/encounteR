#'Random encounter models can be used to estimate animal abundances 
#'    and densities. They are particularly useful for studies using camera traps
#'    and acoustic detectors. They generally assume that animals move randomly
#'    in space. The expected nuber of encounters between the animal population 
#'    and the sensors can then be calculated. Given a certain numbe
