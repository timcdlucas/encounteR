Description: Random encounter models can be used to estimate animal abundances 
    and densities. They are particularly useful for studies using camera traps
    and acoustic detectors. They generally assume that animals move randomly
    in space. The expected nuber of encounters between the animal population 
    and the sensors can then be calculated. Given a certain number of
    detections, we can work out the unknown population density.
